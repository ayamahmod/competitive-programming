// Given an array of non-negative integers that represent the bars (y value)
// in a histogram (with the array index being the x value),
// find the rectangle with the largest area under the curve and above the axis.
 // the pair of array indices that represent the rectangle.
//
// Test Cases
//
// Note that there may be other valid answers.
//
// For array [2,4,2,1], largest area is 6, with height 2, and width from indices 0 to 2.
//
// For array [2,4,2,1,10,6,10] the largest area is 18, with height 6 and width from indices 4 to 6.
